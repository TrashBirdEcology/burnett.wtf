I am a Research Ecologist and [Mendenhall Postdoctoral Fellow](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/mendenhall) at the U.S. Geological Survey Core Science Systems [Science Analytics and Synthesis](https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/science-analytics-and-synthesis/about). I am motivated most by the promise of using __extant data__ to inform ecological understanding, and a paycheck helps. 

Much of my work to date has relied on existing data, like the [USGS North American Breeding Bird Survey](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/pwrc/science/north-american-breeding-bird-survey), to understand bird population dynamics. 

However, I am extremely interested in improving the computational workflows of scientists and natural resource practitioners by creating tools (e.g. R package [bbsAssistant](github.com/trashbirdecology/bbsassistant)), or improving models and methods.
