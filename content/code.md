I love and hate coding.


Most of my code is open and available on [Github](github.com/trashbirdecology). 

I am currently maintaining or have significantly contributed to the following coding or software development projects:  
  - [bbsAssistant](github.com/trashbirdecology/bbsassistant)  
  - [USAvian](github.com/trashbirdecology/usavian)  
  - [regimedetectionmeasures](https://github.com/TrashBirdEcology/regimeDetectionMeasures)  
  - [radsets](https://github.com/natbprice/radsets)
