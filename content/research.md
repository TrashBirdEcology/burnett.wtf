I am motivated most by the promise of using __extant data__ to inform ecological understanding. Much of my work to date has relied on existing data, like the [USGS North American Breeding Bird Survey](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/pwrc/science/north-american-breeding-bird-survey), to understand bird population dynamics.
