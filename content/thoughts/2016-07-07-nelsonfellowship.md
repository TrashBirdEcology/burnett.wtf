I recently received the Nelson Memorial Fellowship from the Institute of Agricultural and Natural Resources at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln for travel to Washington, D.C. for the North American Ornithological Congress VI! I am grateful for the support the donors, Drs. Stuart O. and Don.J Nelson, have provided me to discuss my research, and the advancements and future of big data ornithology. I will also be presenting preliminary results from my dissertation research in a presentation titled, "Detecting broad-scale regime shifts using the Breeding Bird Survey Data".
