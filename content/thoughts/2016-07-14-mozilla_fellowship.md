title: Application for Mozilla Fellow for Science
type: post
---

For the past few weeks I have been crafting my application to become a Mozilla Fellow for Science. Although the application process is relatively straight forward, the questions were tough: word limits force you to craft concise answers.  

I learned a lot during the process, and got around to some Rmarkdown development I have been putting off.   

Here is my package, sans my supervisor's letter and contact information.
Regardless of the outcome, I am excited to have learned about Mozilla's dedication to opening science and initiatives to advancing open data and science at the local, regional, and global levels.
