Perhaps unsurprisingly, if not for the few positions available, I was **not** selected for the [https://mozilla-science-lab.forms.fm/mozilla-fellows-for-science-2016](Mozilla Fellows for Science program). I wanted to note here, however, that like many proposal processes a graduate student (I) applies for but does not receive is well worth their (my) time.

This application forced me to do a few things I have been holding off on, including truly assessing my status and contributions to the open science movement, of which I am particularly an advocate of (both my M.S. and Ph.D. theses are formed about open data), develop my GitHub repositories and .io, and brag about myself in a convincing way via cover letter. 

More detail to be added at a later date.
